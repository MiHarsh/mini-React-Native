I have used Expo CLI tool for this mini-project. It's a lot easier to get started in creating cross platform apps using Expo.

## How to run?

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```
Now open Emulator, or install Expo CLI tool for Android or iPhone, scan the QR Code and use the App.

  

## What this Code do?
A very **Basic TODOlist** app, consisting basic functionalities such as adding new items and deleting them.
To delete the item, simply click on the item name.
